Arduino RRD library
===================

That's a very simple Arduino library that can be used to
periodically collect analog or digital data and store them
in an RRD pool, without interrupting the normal flow of
your program.

Beware that this is just a draft, and not a mature project.


How it works
============

 - copy the RRD directory in you ~/sketchbook/libraries/ directory (if needed, create it)
 - import it in your project with #include \<RRD.h\>
 - refer the the comments in the RRD.cpp file for an usage example.
